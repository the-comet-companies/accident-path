## Source of Truth

**Git repo is the single source of truth for all code and strategy docs.**
- **Repo:** `git@github.com:thecometcompanies/accident-path.git`
- **Never edit strategy docs in Google Drive** — only edit in this repo and push.
- **Notion** is for task tracking only (statuses, assignments, priorities).

## Task Tracking

All tasks are in the Notion Master Pipeline database.
- **Master Pipeline:** [Open](https://www.notion.so/346917dc7b8381e3be62dea1a5250217) (DB ID: `346917dc-7b83-81e3-be62-dea1a5250217`)
- **Phases:** [Open](https://www.notion.so/346917dc7b8381a382f9f9eaf51a875e) (DB ID: `346917dc-7b83-81a3-82f9-f9eaf51a875e`)

Filter by Owner = "Claude" for autonomous tasks.
Each DEV-XX task has a full execution prompt in its Notion page body.

## Rules

### ALWAYS
1. Read `docs/strategy/COMPLIANCE.md` before writing ANY user-facing copy
2. Use careful legal language — never imply legal advice
3. Include disclaimers on every page
4. Use Tailwind CSS only
5. JSON CMS for all content (never hardcode)
6. Target 90+ Lighthouse scores
7. Mobile-first, accessible (WCAG 2.2 AA)

### NEVER
1. Say "We recommend this lawyer" or "You have a case"
2. Give state-specific legal advice without counsel review
3. Present tools as legal advice engines
4. Hardcode content — use JSON CMS
5. Skip disclaimers on any page

### SAFE Language Patterns
```
"Based on what you told us, lawyers who typically handle matters like this include..."
"You may benefit from speaking with a lawyer experienced in..."
"This information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice."
```
